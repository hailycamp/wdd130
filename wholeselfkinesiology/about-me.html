            <h2>Hello, my name is Jamie.</h2>
            <p>
                I am a holistic health counselor, mother of three beautiful daughters, and lover of all things beach and sun. In my pursuit of higher health, I have been blessed to live in some beautiful coastal places, and am currently settled in the sunny state of Florida. Although I've moved around quite a bit, my healing journey coincidentally began not too far from where I am now. And it's amazing to look back and see how far I've come.

                Right after graduating high school, self-care was not a skill I could claim yet. Poor sleep, high stress, and an unpredictable diet created the perfect environment for contracting mononucleosis, better known as mono. Around this time, doctors knew very little information about it and couldn't give much more advice than "rest up". Even though the symptoms started to lessen within a few months, other unexplainable issues began to arise in my physical and emotional health. Going from doctor to doctor, specialist to specialist, no one had any conclusive answers or solutions that could help.

                It wasn't until I discovered a holistic nutritionist in my area, that I began to see real results. I went from frequent infections, aches and pains, and hypoglycemia, to having enough vitality to walk farther and faster than my fit, military husband during my third trimester. What made the difference then? Rather than taking various medications to test my doctors' hypotheses about my symptoms, I implemented nutritional and lifestyle changes and took natural supplements based on the diagnoses my new physician deduced through muscsle testing. Over a decade later, I now use this very tool to help my own clients get to the bottom of the unknown and unexplainable, and empower them with real answers and impressive results too.
