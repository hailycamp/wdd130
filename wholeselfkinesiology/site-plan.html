      <h4>What is Applied Kinesiology?</h4>
      <p>
        Applied kinesiology, or muscle-testing, is a way of gathering information from the body through muscle-response tests, as opposed to the more common blood tests or various body scans, like x-ray and MRI. It falls under the umbrella of alternative medicine and is a method that takes a holistic approach to a person’s health. Applied kinesiology can be practiced by someone in any discipline, as it is simply a method of acquiring information about the body.
      </p>
      <h4>How I Use Muscle Testing</h4>
      <p>
        In my practice (the business owner), I focus on my client’s nutrition, fitness, and the processes of each part of the body as they relate, particularly, to their diet and lifestyle. I go into depth in learning about the root causes of my client’s ailments in order to create the most effective plan for healing.
      </p>
      <h4>Why I Use Muscle Testing</h4>
      <p>
        My greatest desire and goal is the empowering of my clients to make well-informed decisions for their health directly pertaining to the specific needs of their own body.  There is so much information out there that can distract from the wisdom of listening to our own body.  Even professionals in their respective fields may conflict on diagnoses and prescriptions. But true body-wisdom doesn’t lie. With my holistic health panels, you can learn exactly what is going on in your body right now and precisely what it needs to heal, so that you can finally do something about it!
      </p>
      <h4>The Biz Owner’s Story</h4>
      <p>
        I spent much of my early life going from specialist to specialist trying to figure out what was wrong with me. After being told so many different things, I was left only with confusion, frustration, and more questions. It wasn’t until I discovered muscle-testing that the truth slowly began to unfold to me and real solutions started to arise.

      <h3>About Me</h3>
        <p>
          When I first got married, I was diagnosed with mono. With that and the chronic migraines I had suffered since childhood, I had many low days. (Further describe that experience a bit). Then, I attended a convention for the author of a book I recently read. Next, I started going to a physician who used muscle testing. I moved a couple times before encountering another woman who used muscle testing and she began to teach me. Things started coming together and I began to get more answers. I have been practicing for 5+ years and have created my own ways of testing for others and finding answers beneath the questions… (expound on the owner’s experiences, success, and learnings)

      <h3>Services</h3>
        <h4>Digestive Health Panel</h4>
        <p>
          Ever wonder why some foods don’t agree with you? Or why you’re always bloated or cramping in your gut? In this test, you will learn about the inner workings of your entire digestive tract. It includes a complete breakdown of each essential part or process of your body that contributes to digestion, in addition to a broad look at the various types of nutrients and your ability to digest and process them. This panel provides the ultimate guidance for healing and nurturing your gut.
        </p>
        <h4>System Workup</h4>
        <p>
          This test will give you a comprehensive picture of every system of your body, including each of the corresponding organs, glands, and essential parts. The system workup was designed to evaluate total health by examining the health and functionality of each individual part of the body. Due to the breadth of this assessment, it may offer clues, or even answers, as to any symptoms you haven’t been able to explain up until now. The results of this test will offer a better idea of where to focus your attention for additional holistic, nutritional, and supplemental support.
        </p>
        <h4>Food Tolerance Panel</h4>
        <p>
          This panel is the most comprehensive one I offer. It provides you a detailed list of the most common foods in the American diet from every food group and describes its impact on your body, your ability to digest it, whether a digestive enzyme is needed, and much more. This panel takes the guesswork and the stress out of shopping and eating. From here, you can easily craft your meals and shopping trips around foods that make you feel good and live better.
