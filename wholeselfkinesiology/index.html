                <h3>Hello! My name is Jamie.</h3>
                <p>
                    I spent much of my early life going from specialist to specialist trying to figure out what was wrong with me. After being told so many different things, I was left only with confusion, frustration, and more questions. It wasnâ€™t until I discovered muscle-testing that the truth slowly began to unfold to me and real solutions started to arise.

            <h3>Guess What?</h3>
            <p>
                I use muscle testing, a form of applied kinesiology, to get to the root causes of symptoms and ailments. Muscle testing is simply a way of gathering information from the body through muscle-response tests, as opposed to the more common blood tests or body scans, like x-ray and MRI, and can be practiced by someone in any health discipline.
