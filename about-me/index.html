                My name is Haily. I am from a mixture of beautiful coastal places: California, Florida, and Hawaii. I love tropical nature, temperate climates, and lots of sun, as well as a good thunderstorm here and there. 3 years ago, I married my husband, Jacob. And now I am a mother to my sweet little 3 month old baby boy, Odin.

                My two greatest loves, aside from my family and God, are beauty and systems. I like to be creative and design masterpieces, in addition to creating functional systems to make living and working so much easier. This lends to my many hobbies and interests, including watercolor, graphic design, entrepreneurship, computer programming, and interior design! I have dabbled in so many things throughout my life, I am so ready to finally master something. I happily own my identity as a jack-of-all-trades, but I am hoping I can become really good at web development so I can become more easily employable, and just be able to have fun with the incredible systems I can create!
